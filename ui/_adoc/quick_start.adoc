.*Product Overview*
[%collapsible]
====
Use AI to predict outcomes of chemical reactions, retrosynthesis pathways, and experimental procedures. All using infrastructure that performs analyses quickly and securely.

Our tool is based on molecular transformer models trained on 2.5 million chemical reactions. This class of models is flexible, non-rule-based, and scalable.  Users never have to wait in queues, resulting in faster results and better uptime.

* A visual drawing editor allows you to add your own chemical structures and explore RXN’s features.
* Create projects and collaborate on complex multi-step reaction syntheses or novel chemical reaction designs.
* Simple APIs allow you to run predictions at scale without worrying about provisioning, managing, and monitoring backend resources.
* Integrate these API calls into your own workflows with minimal setup.
* AI models generate results without human bias, creating new discovery opportunities.

NOTE: In the RXN for Chemisty tool, models of molecules and reactions may be organized into _projects_. Each project may contain several molecular and reaction models, and each project may be accessed and worked on by multiple team members. Each project is access controlled by allowing only specified teams or individuals to access the project resources.
====

.*Step 5:* View the Project Dashboard
[%collapsible]
====
You will be taken to the Project Dashboard for your new project. After viewing your project Dashboard, click on the *Home* link on the left hand menu.

====

.*Step 9:* Add new model to pre-existing project or new project
[%collapsible]
====
Add to a pre-existing project by selecting *Add to pre-existing project* then selecting the Project name from the drop down list. 

Or you may create and name a new project by selecting *Add to a brand new project.*

====

.*Step 10:* Select *Start from target molecule*, then click *Predict retrosynthetic routes*
[%collapsible]
====
Select *Target molecule* in the dialog box to use the built-in molecule editor to create a model of the target molecule.

Click the button *Predict retrosynthetic routes*. This will take you to the visual molecule editor.

TIP: Instead of selecting *Target molecule*, you may select *From file* to upload a file containing one or more SMILES strings of target molecules.

.*Step 11:* Start building a molecule in the visual editor
[%collapsible]
====
The visual editor in RXN for Chemistry is illustrated below.  Note the icons in the toolbars located in each side of the visual editor window.  

image:./images/step11.png[Screenshot]

[TIP]
=====
The molecular modeling tool used in RXN for Chemistry is based on the open source tool Ketcher. The tool is very easy to use and you may view the guide for Ketcher by clicking on the links below.

* link:./help/index.html[icon:file-code-o[2x]  Ketcher guide in HTML,window=_target]
* link:./help/rxn_ketcher.pdf[icon:file-pdf-o[2x]  Ketcher guide in PDF,window=_target] 
=====

For this tutorial, we will enter a molecule named *paliperidone palmitate* (brand name Invega Sustenna). This compound is the active ingredient in medication used to treat schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, and it is classified as an atypical antipsychotic drug.

Here is the 2D structure of the compound as provided by PubChem:

The complete PubChem reference for this compound is located at link:https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/9852746[window=_target]

[TIP]
=====
*Please use the Ketcher guide (if needed) and the PubChem reference to practice constructing the molecule in Ketcher.*
=====
====

.*Step 12:* Use the SMILES string editor
[%collapsible]
====
After entering the molecule into the visual editor click on the button labeled *SMILES string editor* at the top of the screen. 

The SMILES string should appear as follows:

`CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC(=O)OC1CCCN2C1=NC(=C(C2=O)CCN3CCC(CC3)C4=NOC5=C4C=CC(=C5)F)C`

TIP: Instead of building the compound from scratch in the visual editor, you may copy/paste the SMILES string (or any SMILES strings) into the SMILES string editor to quickly add the molecule to  your visual editor workspace.

NOTE: The button labeled *Validate SMILES string* will check the validity of the molecule entered.

====

.*Tutorial completed*
