.*Step 12:* After selecting a predicted reaction click the icon for *Predict reaction properties* in upper right
[%collapsible]
====
The icon for Predict reaction properties is shown below.

NOTE: The algorithms for predicting reaction properties take a representation of the reaction (Condensed Graph of Reaction, CGR) and use it as input to a graph-based convolutional neural network.  See this article for an example of this approach: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jcim.1c00975#

.*Step 15:* Click on the TMAP icon as shown below 
[%collapsible]
====
This will take you to a visual TMAP showing your retrosynthesis results in the context of other chemical structures and properties. 

[NOTE]
========

*What is a TMAP?*

TMAP (TreeMAP) is a set of algorithms to help visualize high-dimensional data sets containing chemical structures. It provides the ability to visualize such data while preserving both global and local features with a sufficient level of detail to allow for human inspection and interpretation.

For more information on TMAP see the following:

* https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-020-0416-x[Journal of Cheminformatics paper on TMAP]

.*Step 20:* Click on the icon for "Copy fingerprint" as shown below
[%collapsible]
====

The reaction fingerprint for the predicted product reaction will be copied to the clipboard of your browser. You may then paste it into a text document.

[NOTE]
========
A unique "fingerprint" for a chemical reaction can be computed and used as a means to compare molecules and reactions for similarity. 

For more information on fingerprints as used here, see the following: link:https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-020-00284-w.epdf?sharing_token=CGHu6tcqBiFmC1nRfnOrxNRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0NiJSBmQfyOiLfbwen1TgEszNU5Xao_0Gs7D0u8tLUOJxaLAUc469WZKWG5K9wsqIe98dZOREVhQ33gqcr33AgNUjnp4cVXojp4aKe2xCbWtNaxOZtpOjBOsdX3O8yxVkI%3D[Mapping the space of chemical reactions using attention-based neural networks]

.*Step 21:* Click on the icon for "Attention weights" as shown below
[%collapsible]
====
A small box will open with a heat map of attention weights calculated when the product prediction was derived.

TIP: Right-click on the heat map and select "Open image in new tab" for a higher resolution view.

[NOTE]
========
The attention weight heat map is derived from the attention weights calculated while RXN is generating predictions. Attention weights reflect the molecular interactions in the reaction that were most critical when predicting the product (Y-axis of the heat map) from the reactants (X-axis of the heat map).

The following article provides a simple overview of attention in machine learning models: link:https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/understanding-attention-in-transformers-models-57bada0cce3e#:~:text=Steps%20to%20calculating%20Attention&text=Take%20the%20query%20vector%20for,attention%20score%20or%20attention%20weight%20.[Understanding Attention In Transformers Models]
