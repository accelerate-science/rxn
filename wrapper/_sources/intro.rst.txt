What is RXN for Chemistry?
---------------------------

Use AI to predict outcomes of chemical reactions, retrosynthesis pathways, and experimental procedures. All using infrastructure that performs analyses quickly and securely.

Our tool is based on molecular transformer models trained on 2.5 million chemical reactions. This class of models is flexible, non-rule-based, and scalable. Users never have to wait in queues, resulting in faster results and better uptime.

* A visual drawing editor allows you to add your own chemical structures and explore RXNâ€™s features.

* Create projects and collaborate on complex multi-step reaction syntheses or novel chemical reaction designs.

* Simple APIs allow you to run predictions at scale without worrying about provisioning, managing, and monitoring backend resources.

* Integrate these API calls into your own workflows with minimal setup.

* AI models generate results without human bias, creating new discovery opportunities.
