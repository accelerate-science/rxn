Projects

What is a Project?
-------------------

The artifacts and results from the four RXN tools listed below can be saved to a project. Projects
help to organize analyses, enable collaboration, and may be shared with colleagues.

-  Predict retrosynthesis
-  Predict product
-  Predict reagents
-  Plan a synthesis

For on-premise installations (uncommon)
---------------------------------------

For those with an on-premise installation of RXN for Chemistry, you must refer to your on-premise installation via an environment variable:

.. code:: console

    export RXN4CHEMISTRY_BASE_URL="https://some.other.rxn.server"

Or by setting a different host in your python code:

.. code:: ipython3

    # uncomment the line below to set a different host
    # rxn.set_base_url('https://some.other.rxn.server')

Create a new project
--------------------

To create a project, run the ``create_project`` function.

This step can be skipped if you want to use a project that you have
created previously.

.. code:: ipython3

    rxn.create_project("rxn4chemistry_tour")
    rxn.set_project(rxn.project_id)
    print(f"The project ID is {rxn.project_id}")

Choose an existing project
--------------------------

If you have already created the project, you can work within it by
running ``set_project``.

.. code:: ipython3

    rxn.set_project("YOUR_PROJECT_ID")
